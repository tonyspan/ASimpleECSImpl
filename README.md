# A Simple ECS Implementation

This project is a very simple implementation of ECS architectural pattern, based on what I have seen and read about it.

The Entity Component System model (ECS) stands out as having a flexible and
extensible architecture that avoids the pitfalls of the common object-oriented approach
to game engine development. By adopting a database-like approach, the ECS model
effectively decouples logic from data and facilitates modular development. The ECS
architecture is made up of three sections: entities, components, and systems.

Also, first time I used [Premake](https://premake.github.io/).
